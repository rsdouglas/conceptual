# Conceptual

**Automated Dubberly-style concept modeling for codebases**

Conceptual analyzes your codebase and generates rich, Dubberly-style concept models automatically using LLM-powered analysis. It discovers domain concepts, relationships, rules, lifecycles, and creates focused diagram views—helping teams understand and communicate system architecture.

## What is a Dubberly-style Concept Model?

[Hugh Dubberly's concept modeling approach](http://www.dubberly.com/concept-maps) focuses on visualizing **domain concepts** (things, activities, roles, states, events) and their **relationships**, rather than technical implementation details.

Conceptual brings this methodology to code analysis:

- 🎯 **Domain-focused** - Identifies real-world concepts, not just classes/functions
- 🔗 **Relationship-aware** - Maps how concepts connect and interact
- 📊 **Multi-view** - Generates focused diagram perspectives for different audiences
- 🔄 **Lifecycle tracking** - Captures how concepts change state over time
- 📜 **Rules & constraints** - Documents business logic and invariants

Perfect for:
- Understanding AI-generated codebases
- Onboarding new developers
- PM & stakeholder alignment
- Domain language standardization
- Architecture communication
- System refactoring & design

## ✨ Features

### Three-Phase Analysis Pipeline

```
1. Discovery      → Identify high-level domain structure
2. Enrichment     → Analyze code to fill in concept details
3. View Generation → Design focused diagrams from enriched models
```

Each phase uses targeted LLM analysis to build progressively richer understanding.

### 🔍 Concept Discovery
Automatically identifies domain concepts from code:
- Things, activities, roles, states, events
- Business rules and constraints
- Lifecycle state machines
- Concept relationships and interactions

### 📊 Multi-View Diagrams
Generated focused diagram perspectives:
- **System Overview** - High-level architecture
- **Subsystem Views** - Focused flows (e.g., "Slack Bot", "Admin UI")
- **Role-based Views** - Stakeholder perspectives
- **Layer Views** - Organized by architectural layer

### 🗺️ Interactive Domain Explorer
A modern Tailwind-powered viewer:
- Project overview with concept relationships
- Drill-down into concept details and lifecycles
- Multiple diagram perspectives
- Direct links to source code

### ⚡ Fast and Local
Works entirely offline.
No data or source code leaves your machine.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install

```bash
cd conceptual
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Analyze a codebase

```bash
cd conceptual
pnpm dev analyze /path/to/repo
```

This will:
1. Scan TypeScript/JavaScript files
2. Discover project structure and domain concepts
3. Enrich concepts with details, relationships, and rules
4. Generate focused diagram views
5. Write `docs/domain/concept-model.json`
6. Publish to viewer (if available)

### Run the viewer

```bash
cd viewer
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to explore your concept models interactively.
